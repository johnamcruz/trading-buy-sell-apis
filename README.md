# üöÄ AutoTrade Connector  
**Turn Your TradingView Alerts into Live Trades on TopstepX ‚Äî Running Safely on Your Own Machine**

---

## üéØ What It Is  
AutoTrade Connector is a simple webhook service that links your **TradingView alerts** directly to **TopstepX** for automatic trade execution ‚Äî and it runs **locally on your computer**.

You stay in full control. No cloud servers, no third-party hosting.

---

## üîß How It Works
1. **Download and run the connector** locally (lightweight nodeJS app).
2. **Set up an alert** in TradingView using your custom webhook URL.
3. **Your alert fires** (e.g. MACD crossover, breakout, etc.).
4. **The local bot receives it**, processes it, and sends the trade to **TopstepX**.
5. ‚úÖ Your trade is placed ‚Äî automatically and securely from your machine.

## ‚úÖ Why Use It?
- **Runs 100% on your computer** (you own the execution)
- **No coding or cloud setup required**

### üñ• macOS & Linux: Run `setup.sh`

### 1. Run the setup script

Use the appropriate script for your system:

#### macOS/Linux:
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

#### Windows (Run in PowerShell as Administrator):
```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

This script will:

- Check for and install required tools (Git, Node.js)
- Clone the project repository
- Install all dependencies via `npm install`
- Set up a `.env` file if `.env.example` exists

---

### 2. Configure environment variables

After the script completes, update the `.env` file located in the project root.

If a `.env.example` file exists, it will be copied automatically.

Set the required variables:

```env
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
API_URL=https://your.api.url
API_USER=your_api_user
```

> üí° These values are required for the application to run properly.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Application

To start the server with http tunnel:

```bash
npm run tunnel
```

This command will:

- Launch the Express server locally on port `3000`
- Automatically establish a public http tunnel to your local server
- Display the public http URL you can use to send TradingView webhooks
