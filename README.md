## üß™ Available API Endpoints

You can test the following routes after starting the server:

* `POST /enter`
  Place a buy or sell order.

* `POST /exit`
  Exit current position.

**Example `curl` request:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/enter
```

## üì¨ Notes

* This is a **basic in-memory API** ‚Äî data is lost when the server restarts.
* Great for learning or testing small trading logic flows.
* No external database or persistent storage is used.
* **Designed to receive alerts as JSON webhooks from TradingView and TrendSpider.**
