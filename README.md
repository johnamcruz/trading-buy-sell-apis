# üì¶ Trading Buy/Sell APIs ‚Äì Installation & Running Guide

This project provides simple trading-related buy/sell API endpoints for ProjectX APIs using Node.js and Express. It is designed to be wired up as **webhooks for TradingView and TrendSpider alerts**. Follow the steps below to install dependencies, configure the project, and run the server locally.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

* **Node.js** (v14 or later recommended)
  üëâ Download from: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
* **npm** (comes with Node.js)
* (Optional but helpful) **Postman or cURL** to test API endpoints
* (Optional but recommended) **[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)** to expose your local server for webhook testing

## üöÄ Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/johnamcruz/trading-buy-sell-apis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   ```bash
   cd trading-buy-sell-apis
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **(Optional) Configure environment variables**

   The project uses environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root directory and set any required keys for the following: API_KEY, API_URL, and API_USER

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Application

To start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the server runs on **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

## üåê Expose Localhost with Ngrok (for Webhooks)

To receive webhook requests from TradingView or TrendSpider, your local server must be accessible over the internet. Use **ngrok** to create a public HTTPS URL that tunnels to your localhost:

1. **Install ngrok** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   npm install -g ngrok
   ```

2. **Start ngrok**:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

3. **Copy the HTTPS URL** displayed by ngrok (e.g., `https://abcd1234.ngrok.io`) and use it in your TradingView or TrendSpider webhook configuration:

   * For buy alert: `https://abcd1234.ngrok.io/api/enter?side=0`
   * For sell alert: `https://abcd1234.ngrok.io/api/enter?side=1`

## üß™ Available API Endpoints

You can test the following routes after starting the server:

* `POST /enter`
  Place a buy or sell order.

* `POST /exit`
  Exit current position.

**Example `curl` request:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/enter
```

---

## üì¨ Notes

* This is a **basic in-memory API** ‚Äî data is lost when the server restarts.
* Great for learning or testing small trading logic flows.
* No external database or persistent storage is used.
* **Designed to receive alerts as JSON webhooks from TradingView and TrendSpider.**
